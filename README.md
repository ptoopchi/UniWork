# UniWork
This is some work i have done while at University. Some of these projects are yet not completed and will be updated soon

NOTE:
the sprint4 miniproject was a small task at university, which required me to fill in some of the coding so that the database connected to Spring MVC website so it can exchange data such as login information.
